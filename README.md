# OSM-logo-embroidery
Resository for the OpenStreetMap logo for embroidery.

The SVG file is the source file based on the official OSM logo from the wiki. The SVG file is edited in Inkscape with the Ink/stitch plugin that allows to create embroidery files.

The PDF and the PES files are generated from the SVG. These files could be given to a embroidery services company to work on Caps, Shirts or other fabrics where you want to embroider the OpenStreetMap logo.

The PNG is for reference to compare the original logo, with the simplified one for embroidery. As part of the simplifications, several layers were removed (zoom, shadows, numbers, textures) and only the basic forms remain in the final design.
